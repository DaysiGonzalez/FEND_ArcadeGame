## Instructions

This project is part of the Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program.

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

To run this project you should use the index.html file.

The objective of this game is to get the player to the water area without collided with the enemies.  Every time you get to the water, one point is added to the score, every time you hit an enemy, score is set to zero.
